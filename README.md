Introduction
The HKD Stable Token (HKDST) is a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the Hong Kong Dollar
(HKD) and backed by the decentralized USD-pegged stablecoin, DAI. This innovative solution
leverages blockchain technology to provide users with a reliable, transparent, and trustless
method of transacting in HKD on the blockchain. HKDST dynamically adjusts its value based on
real-time HKD/USD exchange rates fetched from Chainlink's decentralized oracles.
